## How Artificial Intelligence improve the future of human life in Medicine and Imaging?



## Introduction 

Artificial Intelligence is a developing technology who has been around for many years. AI has the potential to be used in medicine in many cases to improve the efficiency of patient records, monitor diseases, assist in surgical procedures, aid diagnosis, and offer mental health therapy. AI is helping radiologists with some tasks, patient scheduling, billing, staffing optimization, protocol formulation, picture quality assessment, radiation dose reduction, and image interpretation. Artificial Intelligence is very important, and it has a special ability not even the expert human eye can’t see it for example to consume massive quantities of data, decipher images, and find patterns, but when we talk about medicine we want to know If AI technology will improve medicine?
AI Technology improve medicine if experts in computer science, medicine, policy, mathematics, ethics, and other fields will work together. One of the events examined developing clinical machine learning technologies with an emphasis on technical advancements, data ethics, policy, and legislation, and featured world specialists in computer science, and on medicine, in industry, and government. Scripps Research’s is author, cardiologist and famous researcher he sees three areas where AI has the most potential to transform medicine. The first one is very important it is reducing medical errors that lead to misdiagnosis, he had made a study about that in NYU and he found that human pathology combined with AI is better at finding breast cancers this is better to do it with AI not alone, especially in reducing false-negative mammograms, which is not good to let women to wait longer for treatment. Second will be a slew of new apps to help individuals manage their health throughout their lives, such as smartphone apps that diagnose skin diseases. It’s not enough just developing medical AI products. Even when we have the best product in the world won’t help if we can’t use it. AI in medical imaging continues to demonstrate that is very worthy.


## How Al affected radiology

Radiology practice is changing by artificial intelligence and the learning process in radiology will be changed in a similar way. Radiologists should understand the first wave of artificial intelligent technologies, how they can help them improve their practice, and how to properly monitor their use in the short term. Radiologists are working under more pressure than ever before. In the United States it was a study of 50 radiologists, 90 % had said their workload had increased in these three years. According to scholarly literature, the more scans performed, the more radiologists are required to read them quickly and accurately.



## What progress has artificial intelligence made in medical imaging? 

It has been a study with a significant progress in the use of AI in numerous imaging modalities and therapeutic sector. This year AI was able to identify four different diseases in chest radiographs pulmonary malignant neoplasms, this part includes primary lung cancer and metastasis, active pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia and pneumothorax. This is an important study given the widespread prevalence of these diseases and AI’s ability is to assist radiologists in identifying and to give permission patients with hard diseases or complex cases.In another study was showed that AI-based computer-aided design software recognized fewer false-positives per image in digital mammograms than FDA-approved software while maintaining sensitivity. AI has made significant advances in other areas, such as the treatment planning of brain tumours and the recognition of catheters and tubes in paediatric x-ray pictures. In areas where radiologists are unavailable, AI will help to increase access to care, and it will contribute to the improvement of workflow and efficiency.
Some diagnostics companies have begun to invest in AI-assisted medical imaging, either through acquisitions or partnerships, or by creating their own capabilities. AI could improve the image quality and interpretation of MRIs in some diseases like arthritis of the knee. Siemens Healthineers had made an artificial intelligence introduction that explore and measure probable anomalies on a chest CT scan, GE Healthcare and intel created a partnership to apply AI to a variety of medical imaging formats. Philips bought Carestream Health's health care information systems division, which uses artificial intelligence to diagnose and prioritize patients with osteoporosis, pulmonary emphysema, coronary calcification, and fatty liver. Among the main IT companies interested in AI-assisted medical imaging are Google, Apple, IBM, and Microsoft. Google has worked with Zebra Medical imaging, Change Healthcare, and Kanteron Systems and all of them are working for AI in medical imaging. Meanwhile, Microsoft has invested in artificial intelligence platform for developers in order to improve medical imaging diagnosis, while Amazon has introduced an AI-powered service that quickly de-identifies medical images. Some people are starting to see the benefits of AI apps and are testing more of their own and commercial apps. Machines are incapable of thinking, but they can learn. Radiology is trying to figure out how to predict the future.



## Will Artificial Intelligence Replace Doctors?

Doctors will probably certainly not be able to be replaced by artificial intelligence. Physicians can use smart medical technology to help them better manage their patients. However, as recent study has shown, comparisons between artificial intelligence solutions and physicians are common, as if the two counterparts were competitors. Future study should compare physicians who employ artificial intelligence solutions to those who don't then expand those comparisons to translational clinical trials, only then will artificial intelligence be recognized as a supplement to physicians.

## Conclusion 

The way we think about health and medicine is changing as a result of artificial intelligence. Al is having a significant impact on how we diagnose physical injuries and study radiation, as computers become more capable of correctly detecting diseases through the analysis of medical images. Since 1968, when computers were initially utilized as assistant radiologists by computerizing the screening of radiological images, artificial intelligence has a significant impact on healthcare. Physicians were able to spot tumors and cancer at a much higher frequency than before, due to the work of computer scientists. From creating a more efficient way of interpreting diagnostic images to automating workflow and data processing, artificial intelligence is becoming the go-to answer for practically every type of medical imaging and radiology challenge.
