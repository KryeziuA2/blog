## Artificial Intelligence's Future in Medicine and Imaging



## Abstract 
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for decades and is still developing as technology progresses. AI can be used in health care to simplify the check-in process for patients, improve the efficiency of patient records, monitor disease, aid diagnosis, assist in surgical procedures, and provide mental health therapy. AI helps radiologists with a variety of tasks, including patient scheduling, billing, staffing optimization, protocol creation, picture quality assessment, radiation dose reduction, and image interpretation. AI should not be feared because it will not replace people; rather, it should be embraced because of its ability to improve and extend human life.



## Introduction

The remarkable ability of artificial intelligence to consume massive quantities of data, decipher images, and find patterns that even the most expert human eye misses has sparked hope that the technology may improve medicine. Experts in computer science, medicine, policy, mathematics, ethics, and other fields will need to work together to realize the full potential of this opportunity. The event examined developing clinical machine learning technologies with an emphasis on technical advancements, data ethics, policy, and legislation, and featured world specialists in computer science, and on medicine, in industry, and government. Scripps Research's noted cardiologist, researcher, and author Eric Topol sees three areas where AI has the most potential to transform medicine. The first is in reducing medical errors that lead to misdiagnosis, he said, citing a recent NYU study that found that human pathology combined with AI was better at finding breast cancers than either alone, especially in reducing false-negative mammograms, which cause many women to wait longer for treatment. "This is critical information," Topol stated. "AI has the ability to see things that the human eye cannot." There will be a slew of new apps to help individuals manage their health throughout their lives, such as smartphone apps that diagnose skin malignancies. Developing medical AI products isn't enough. It's all about getting those products in front of people. "The best product in the world won't help if people can't use it,". As AI in medical imaging continues to demonstrate its value, it is difficult to believe that AI will not eventually alter radiology.

## How Al affected radiology

Today's radiologists are working under more pressure than ever before. In a study of 50 radiologists in the United States, 90% stated their workload had increased in the previous three years, with 28% saying it had increased by more percent of those who reported a greater workload. The more scans performed, the greater the need for radiologists to read them fast and precisely, according to scholarly literature.

 ## Progress in the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging

Since our last study, there has been significant development in the use of AI in several imaging modalities and therapeutic fields. For example, pulmonary malignant neoplasms, including primary lung tumours and metastases; active pulmonary tuberculosis; pneumonia; and pneumothorax were all identified and distinguished by AI in a recent study. Given the widespread prevalence of these diseases and AI's ability to assist radiologists in identifying and prioritizing patients with the most severe or complex cases, this is an important discovery. It was a study with Alâ€™s efficiency as a second reader in conjunction with a radiologist for example, enhancing lesion localization. Another study found that AI-based computer-aided design software detected less false-positives per image in digital mammograms than FDA-approved software, with no sensitivity loss. In other areas, such as the treatment planning of brain tumours and the recognition of catheters and tubes in paediatric x-ray images, AI has made significant advances.



## Al medical imaging investment

Large, well-established diagnostics firms have also started investing in AI-assisted medical imaging, either through acquisitions or collaborations, or by developing their own skills. In some diseases, such as arthritis of the knee, AI could improve the image clarity and interpretation of MRIs. Siemens Healthineers has introduced an artificial intelligence (AI) system that detects and measures probable anomalies on a chest CT scan. Parallel to this, GE Healthcare and Intel created a partnership to apply AI to a variety of medical imaging formats. Philips purchased Carestream Health's health care information systems division, which has been using artificial intelligence to help detect and prioritize patients with osteoporosis, pulmonary emphysema, coronary calcification, and fatty liver. Google, Apple, IBM, and Microsoft are among the big IT companies that are interested in AI-assisted medical imaging. For the time being, however, most people are backing the AI solutions of others. For example, Google has teamed with Zebra Medical Imaging, Change Healthcare, and Kanteron Systems, all of whom are working on AI in medical imaging. Meanwhile, Microsoft has invested in its artificial intelligence platform for developers with the goal of boosting medical imaging diagnoses, while Amazon has launched an AI-powered service that quickly de-identifies medical photos. Human plus machine is the present and future of medical imaging. The potential for AI to speed up and increase radiologists' ability to interpret images has piqued their interest. Some are beginning to reap the benefits of AI apps and are putting more of their own and commercial apps to the test. Healthcare, like many other businesses, is relying on AI to swiftly extract insights from data, making data more relevant and actionable. Machines do not have the ability to think, but they can learn. Radiology is figuring out how to determine the future.




## Will Artificial Intelligence Replace Doctors?
Artificial intelligence will almost certainly not be able to replace doctors: Smart medical technologies are available to assist physicians in better managing their patients. However, as recent research has shown, comparisons between artificial intelligence solutions and physicians frequently occur, as if the two counterparts were in competition. Future research should compare physicians who use artificial intelligence solutions against physicians who don't, and then expand those comparisons to translational clinical trials; only then will artificial intelligence be acknowledged as a supplement to physicians.

## Conclusion 
Artificial intelligence is altering the way we look at health and medicine. With computers increasing able to accurately detect diseases through analyzing medical images, Al is also making a huge impact in the way we diagnose physical injuries and analyze radiation. Artificial intelligence has had a major impact on healthcare for many years, with computers first being used as assistant radiologists by computerizing screening of radiological images back in 1968. Relying on the work of computer scientists, physicians were able to identify tumors and cancer at a much higher frequency than they were able to previously. Now artificial intelligence is the go-to solution for virtually every kind of medical imaging and radiology problem, from creating a more efficient way of interpreting diagnostic images to automating workflow and data processing.
